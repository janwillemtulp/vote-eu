        <h2>Vote matching, but the other way around</h2>
        <p>
          2019 vote EU is an online tool that allows you to explore the opinions
          of over 250 political parties from 28 EU member states on 22 policy
          statements for the 2019 European Elections.
        </p>
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
          First select the country you wish to explore. Then for any of the
          statements, click on Agree, Neutral, Disagree or No Opinion. This will
          filter all the political parties to only those who also provided that
          opinion for that statement. It also marks all the statements that
          these filtered parties all agree on, or have some mixed opinions on.
          Continue clicking narrowing down the list. You'll be surprised how
          quickly you find unique combinations. Enjoy!
        </p>
        <h3>What is different from other vote matching sites?</h3>
        <p>
          Many vote matching sites ask you to provide your opinion on a set of
          policy statements, and after optionally setting weights for the
          opinions that are most important to you, you get an overview of which
          party matches best with your opinions. And although this works fine,
          the approach from 2019 vote EU is different:
          <em>
            ultimately, if you vote for a political party, you vote for all of
            the opinions of that political party. So, it doesn't really matter
            if your opinion matches 50% or 75%, you vote for the complete
            package of opinions of that party
          </em>
          . This means that it is valuable to get a sense of overview: how does
          this party differ from the others? Does it have unique positions? If I
          agree with this position, what do I automatically agree with if I vote
          for them? etc.
        </p>
        <p>This can yield some interesting insights, for instance:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In Sweden, all of the parties are against the legalization of the
            personal use of soft drugs. So, even before the elections, we
            already know that 1) if you're from Sweden and have a different
            opinion, you're out of luck, and 2) all of the 20 MEP's in EU
            Parliament representing Sweden that will be elected will have this
            opinion, guaranteed.
          </li>
          <li>
            In The Netherlands, Green Left and Democrats '66 agree on 21 of 22
            statements. At least based on these statements, there is hardly a
            difference between these two.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Malta there are just 3 political parties. For some statements
            each of them has a distinct opinion. If you have a strong opinion
            about one of these, then this single statement may determine which
            party matches the given opinion best.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data</h3>

          The source of the data is the

          but in consent with the authors of EU and I the data could already be
          used. Read more about how

          on May 2nd, 2019. The data has not been modified except for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The original data distinguishes between "strongly agree" and "tend
            to agree", as well as "strongly disagree" and "tend to disagree".
            2019 vote EU groups these into "agree" and "disagree" respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            EU and I allows you to select between Walloon and Flemish. The 2019
            vote EU merges these into a single Belgium country.

          be used freely by everyone who wishes to explore policy positions of
          political parties for the EU 2019 elections. It’s important to know
          how many people visit the website, it gives an indication of its

          TULP interactive uses the Google Analytics-service to determine how
          many people visit this website. In order to accurately count unique
          visitors, Google processes personal data of website visitors with the

          TULP interactive has signed a processor agreement with Google, so
          Google acts as a processor. This means Google only processes personal
          data on behalf of TULP interactive. It also entails that the last
          octet of the IP-address is masked, which makes it harder to relate the
          information to specific natural persons. It also means that other
          standard settings are deactivated: like ‘sharing data’ and no other
          Google- services are used in combination with the Google
          Analytics-cookies. Therefore, the aforementioned personal data can be
          processed without the consent of the data subjects (the website
          visitors).
