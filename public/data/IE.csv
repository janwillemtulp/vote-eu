In recent years, working people in Ireland and across the world have been confronted with rising unemployment, precarious work, a dramatic decrease in real income, and increasing prices for food and the essentials of life. At the same time we are seeing decreasing expenditure on the public provision of health, education, housing, welfare and social services, raised retirement ages, attacks on pensions, increased levels of poverty, homelessness and emigration.  This is no accident. It is an inevitable consequence of the present system in which we live. The problem must be tackled at its root by challenging the ownership and control of the economic system.
