          The purpose of processing personal data is to count the number of
          unique website visitors. The processing is necessary for the purposes
          of the legitimate interests pursued by TULP interactive. These
          interests are the following: TULP interactive has made this tool, to
          be used freely by everyone who wishes to explore policy positions of
          political parties for the EU 2019 elections. It’s important to know
          how many people visit the website, it gives an indication of its
          popularity and usage. Considering there is a minimal amount and
          minimal usage of the personal data, the interests of TULP interactive
          prevail.

        <p>
          TULP interactive uses the Google Analytics-service to determine how
          many people visit this website. In order to accurately count unique
          visitors, Google processes personal data of website visitors with the
          help of cookies. These are the following : IP-address, browser and
          device information, and referral information.
        </p>
        <p>
          TULP interactive has signed a processor agreement with Google, so
          Google acts as a processor. This means Google only processes personal
          data on behalf of TULP interactive. It also entails that the last
          octet of the IP-address is masked, which makes it harder to relate the
          information to specific natural persons. It also means that other
          standard settings are deactivated: like ‘sharing data’ and no other
          Google- services are used in combination with the Google
          Analytics-cookies. Therefore, the aforementioned personal data can be
          processed without the consent of the data subjects (the website
          visitors).
        </p>
        <p>
          Using Google services means that this data is transferred to a third
          country (meaning a country outside the EU). Google has made the
          appropriate safeguards.
        </p>
        <p>The data will be stored for a period of 26 months.</p>
        <p>
          Data subjects have the right to request from TULP interactive access
          to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of
          processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing.
          Data subjects also have the right to lodge a complaint with a
          supervisory authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          The persona data gathered with the Google Analytics- cookies is not
          used for automated decision-making, including profiling (as referred
          to in GDPR Article 22(1) and (4). The personal data will also not be
          further processed for a purpose other than that for which the personal
          data were collected.
